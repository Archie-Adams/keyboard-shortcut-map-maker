# Keyboard Shortcut Map Maker

This is a website tool for creating a visual map/image of keyboard shortcuts.  

It originally started as a tool to generate help pages for my [ahk-scripts](https://github.com/Archie-Adams/ahk-scripts) project.

---

### Features:
- Saving and loading shortcut sets via local file.
- Saving a plain HTML page with the shortcuts for use elsewhere.
- Re-ordering the list of keyboards to display shortcuts on different function keys.

### Planned Features:
- Saving shortcuts to an image file.
- An optimized print style.
- Adding section dividers.
- Adding key chord tables/sections.
- Custom colours.
- More elegant styling overall.
- Sound effects with keypress animations.
- Different keyboard layouts.
- One HTML file version of the site.
